# Technical Certifications and Validations

This directory contains the official certifications and digital badges I earned during the AWS re/Start program. These credentials represent a comprehensive validation of my ability to design, secure, and manage professional-grade cloud infrastructure.

As a collective, these certifications prove my proficiency in the four core pillars of cloud engineering: **Networking**, **Security**, **Storage**, and **Database Management**.
