🌥️ AWS re/Start Program — Overview

The AWS re/Start program is a free, full-time skills development and training initiative designed to launch careers in cloud computing. Through hands-on labs, real-world scenarios, and foundational learning in Linux, Python, networking, security, and AWS cloud services, the program builds job-ready cloud practitioners with strong technical and professional skills.

As part of this program, I’ve been developing practical experience in:

☁️ AWS Cloud Architecture & Services (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda and more)

🐧 Linux system fundamentals

🐍 Python programming basics

🔐 Security best practices

🌐 Networking concepts

🤝 Professional and communication skills

My GitHub will showcase projects and labs demonstrating the concepts I’ve learned throughout the program, including cloud deployments, automation tasks, and problem-solving exercises.
