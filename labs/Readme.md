# Technical Labs and Competencies

This directory contains the documented results of my hands-on technical training within the AWS re/Start program. Collectively, these labs demonstrate my ability to operate within a Linux environment, manage cloud networking and security, and deploy scalable infrastructure using core AWS services.

Through this practical work, I have moved beyond theoretical understanding to functional implementation. I can configure virtual private clouds, manage identity and access at scale, and architect storage and compute solutions that follow industry best practices for high availability and security.

## Collective Technical Proficiencies

* **Linux Administration:** Proficiency in command-line navigation, file system management, and user permissions. I can manage server environments via SSH and automate basic tasks using shell scripting.
* **Cloud Security:** Experience implementing the principle of least privilege using AWS IAM. I can configure security groups, network ACLs, and manage encryption for data at rest and in transit.
* **Infrastructure Management:** Ability to launch and manage EC2 instances, configure Elastic Load Balancers, and set up Auto Scaling groups to maintain application performance.
* **Data Management:** Understanding of both relational (RDS) and non-relational (DynamoDB) database deployment and management, including backup and multi-AZ configurations.
* **Cloud Storage:** Practical experience managing object storage with Amazon S3, persistent block storage with Amazon EBS, and centralized file systems with Amazon EFS.
