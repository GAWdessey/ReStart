# Technical Labs and Competencies

This directory contains the documented results of my hands-on technical training within the AWS re/Start program. Collectively, these labs demonstrate my ability to operate within a Linux environment, automate tasks with Python, manage cloud networking and security, and deploy scalable infrastructure using core AWS services.

Through this practical work, I have moved beyond theoretical understanding to functional implementation. I can configure virtual private clouds, manage identity and access at scale, and architect storage and compute solutions that follow industry best practices for high availability and security.

## Collective Technical Proficiencies

* **Cloud Automation:** Proficiency in writing Python scripts using the Boto3 SDK to programmatic manage AWS resources and parse JSON configuration data.
* **Linux Administration:** Skilled in command-line navigation, file system management, and permissions. I can manage server environments via SSH and automate system tasks using Bash scripting.
* **Cloud Security:** Experience implementing "Defense in Depth" using Security Groups and Network ACLs, alongside identity management with AWS IAM.
* **Infrastructure Management:** Ability to launch EC2 instances, configure Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), and deploy Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) for high availability.
* **Data Management:** Understanding of both relational (RDS) and non-relational (DynamoDB) database deployment, including backups and read replicas.
* **Cloud Storage:** Practical experience managing object storage with Amazon S3 and persistent block storage with Amazon EBS.
