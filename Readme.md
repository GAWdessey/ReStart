# AWS Restart Program

This is to track and document the inner workings of the AWS ReStart program. I will be going into detail on performing what to me are the basics of what is needed to know. 
Along with this we have also been asked to perform AWS Cloud Quest missions to attain the below:

## Directory
Labs, I will be showing each individual Lab as I found them, for reference it will be easier to go to and see the information if i label them out like that. 


Summary, is basically just the over view of the course.


### Projects are projects given in the course to complete. 
So far we have had one project
We have had to create a website for a struggling restaurant, that was struggling with demand planning and operational infrastructure problems. 
We used the following services from AWS to complete the tasks
1. S3 to host a static website
2. DynamoDB to connect a back end to track and book sign ups, orders and bookings
3. Lambda to connect the website to the database via functions
