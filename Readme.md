### Projects are projects given in the course to complete.

We have had to create a website for a struggling restaurant, that was struggling with demand planning and operational infrastructure problems. 
We used the following services from AWS to complete the tasks
1. S3 to host a static website
2. DynamoDB to connect a back end to track and book sign ups, orders and bookings
3. Lambda to connect the website to the database via functions
