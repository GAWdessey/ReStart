# AWS re/Start Program Portfolio: Cloud Engineering Journey

Welcome to my professional portfolio. This repository documents my intensive journey through the **AWS re/Start program**, featuring hands-on labs, architectural designs, and industry-recognized certifications.

My goal is to demonstrate a deep understanding of cloud infrastructure, security best practices, and the technical agility to solve real-world business challenges using AWS.

## Featured Projects

### Project 1: Restaurant Website & Operational Backend
**Objective:** Modernize a restaurant's digital presence and demand planning through scalable cloud infrastructure.
* **Stack:** S3 (Static Hosting), DynamoDB (Inventory/Orders), Lambda (Serverless Backend).
* **Impact:** Built a fully integrated backend to track real-time bookings and orders, significantly reducing manual operational overhead through serverless automation.

### Project 2: 3D E-Commerce Platform Architecture
**Objective:** Design a globally available, highly scalable, and cost-efficient infrastructure to support 3D model rendering for millions of users.

* **Scalability:** Implemented **EC2 Auto Scaling** and **AWS Lambda** to handle unpredictable traffic spikes while optimizing costs.
* **Performance:** Leveraged **Amazon CloudFront** to reduce latency for heavy 3D assets and textures globally.
* **Database Strategy:** Utilized a hybrid approach with **RDS** for transactional consistency and **DynamoDB** for high-speed product browsing.
* **Security & Optimization:** Integrated **AWS WAF** for edge security and **Trusted Advisor** to ensure a cost-optimized, secure deployment.

### Project 3: AI-Powered Assessment Bot ('S3Quiz')
**Objective:** Engineer a conversational interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate user knowledge assessment regarding AWS Storage services.
* **Stack:** Amazon Lex V2, AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management).
* **Logic & Architecture:** I designed complex conversation flows with custom Intents and Slots, utilizing conditional branching logic to validate user answers in real-time.
* **Security Configuration:** I implemented granular IAM User policies to securely manage access privileges, enabling role-based testing and collaboration for the development team.
